# CS425_Final-Project

The player is trapped in a maze and must blindly find the exit while avoiding numerous traps that will kill them if activated. An imprint of their death is left behind, and the player must utilize these imprints to safely navigate the maze.


This game utilizies procedural generation to create the maze and to place the traps within it.

Unity is the game engine being used.

An interesting component of this game is that the playerâ€™s vision/view of their surroundings will be limited, so the player is required to die to be able to progress to be able to find the safe path out of the maze.
